- add arg passing in MethodInvoke where the first four args are also placed on the stack (find if this is required first)
- add methodinvoke for non win64 systems
- change some reinterpret casts in stdlib to normal casts
- add runtime member reordering for runtime inheritance once dynamic type generation is allowed (field reordering)
- dynamic generic type generation
	- generic-in-generic type generation/support
		- for this, have the compiler create a list of static generic-in-generics before LLIR in generic IR string
			- have each nested generic assigned a type ident (which the compiler should have already used in its LLIR) and any appearances of `sizeof_TypeIdent` should be replaced with the size of the nested generic by the runtime
- prebuilt generic type loading
- array type deps loading from metadata - WILL NOT IMPL - array types can be created from InitAssembly
- have loader support all valid modifiers for different attributes
- add static ctor support - WILL NOT IMPL - decided that compilers should manage static ctors themselves
- remove switch case blocks in Loader that are always true or false
- Attach vtable calls to method names somehow for jit compilation (e.g. create a mapping between name and number)
