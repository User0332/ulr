- add arg passing in MethodInvoke where the first four args are also placed on the stack (find if this is required first)
- add methodinvoke for non win64 systems
- change some reinterpret casts in stdlib to normal casts
- add runtime member reordering for runtime inheritance once dynamic type generation is allowed (field reordering)
- dynamic generic type generation
	- generic-in-generic type generation/support
		- for this, have the compiler create a list of static generic-in-generics before LLIR in generic IR string
			- have each nested generic assigned a type ident (which the compiler should have already used in its LLIR) and any appearances of `sizeof_TypeIdent` should be replaced with the size of the nested generic by the runtime
- prebuilt generic type loading
- array type deps loading from metadata - WILL NOT IMPL - array types can be created from InitAssembly
- have loader support all valid modifiers for different attributes
- add static ctor support - WILL NOT IMPL - decided that compilers should manage static ctors themselves
- remove switch case blocks in Loader that are always true or false
- Check MethodInfo::Invoke() on a method with more than 4 args
	- If stack space needs to be alloced for the call, execute `sub rsp, 32+((nargs-4)*8)`
		- add bytes back to rsp following the call
		- Probably shouldn't need stack space, just check if it works
		- Also check with large value type
	- Update ConstructorInfo::Invoke() accordingly
- Finish JIT
	- Fix GC to work with JIT assemblies (can you CONTEXT to get register values to also log as locals (or have JIT assemblies create a list of registers that are used for locals to log less))
	- Add call capabilites to JIT
	- Have ULD support reading JIT allocations & JIT interactions
	- Add jmp instrs
	- Attach vtable calls to method names somehow for jit compilation (e.g. create a mapping between name and number)
- TODO: pad all valuetypes to 8 bytes upon loading
