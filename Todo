- make `ulrlocals` work with multithreading
	- do this by making a vector of `ulrlocals` arrs for each thread
	- when threads are created they will add their ulrlocals to the vector
	- impl the GC side logic for this (gc also needs to be able to look through threads)
- add arg passing in MethodInvoke where the first four args are also placed on the stack (find if this is required first)
- finish ConstructorInfo::Invoke method (should just be like methodinfo but with self as first arg and returning nothing)
- efficient vtable for vcalls
- add methodinvoke for non win64 systems
- add gc logic which searches thru arrays (and spans in the future)
- change some reinterpret casts in stdlib to normal casts
- exceptions
- add inheritance and generic type parsing from metadata
	- interface implementation
- add runtime member reordering for runtime inheritance once dynamic type generation is allowed
- dynamic generic type generation
- add destructor loading
- have loader support all valid modifiers for different attributes
- add static ctor support
- test backtrace printing external DLL names
